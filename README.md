A simple program for making learning new concepts from a YouTube video easier.

It's based on the idea of Cognitive Load Management

## What is Cognitive Load Management?

Effective learning involves managing your cognitive load - the mental effort required to process information.

You want to keep your cognitive load in an optimal range, not too high which can lead to overwhelm, or too low which can lead to passive learning.

Techniques like priming and asking non-obvious questions can help manage cognitive load.

### Priming Yourself Before Lectures

Before learning a new idea, review key concepts and relationships to "prime" your brain can reduce cognitive load. To achieve this, we use a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a summary of the video with emphasis on having a simple and high-level overview of the video.

### Asking Non-Obvious Questions

Going beyond basic questions and identify less obvious relationships between concepts forces your brain to explore multiple unusual paths and perspectives, thus reinforcing your understanding.

Similarly, we use the LLM to generate these non-obvious questions about the video content.
